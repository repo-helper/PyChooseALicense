Functions for detecting licenses from files.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

.. extras-require:: detect
	:pyproject:


The prodecure is roughly as follows:

1. Remove copyright line(s).
2. Normalize whitespace (replace all whitespace with a single space).
3. Check for an exact text match with the supported licenses.
4. Failing that, check the edit distance against the supported licenses.
