GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1
======================================

Primarily used for software libraries, the GNU LGPL requires that derived works
be licensed under the same license, but works that only link to it do not fall
under this restriction. There are two commonly used versions of the GNU LGPL.

Permissions
Commercial use – The licensed material and derivatives may be used for
    commercial purposes.
Modification – The licensed material may be modified.
Distribution – The licensed material may be distributed.
Private use – The licensed material may be used and modified in private.

Conditions
License and copyright notice – A copy of the license and copyright notice must
    be included with the licensed material.
Disclose source – Source code must be made available when the licensed material
    is distributed.
State changes – Changes made to the licensed material must be documented.
Same license (library) – Modifications must be released under the same license
    when distributing the licensed material. In some cases a similar or related
    license may be used, or this condition may not apply to works that use the
    licensed material as a library.

Limitations
Liability – This license includes a limitation of liability.
Warranty – This license explicitly states that it does NOT provide any warranty.
