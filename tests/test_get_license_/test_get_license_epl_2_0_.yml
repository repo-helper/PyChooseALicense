content: "Eclipse Public License - v 2.0\n\n    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\
  \ UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\n    PUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE,\
  \ REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE\
  \ OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the\
  \ case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this\
  \ Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes\
  \ to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes\
  \ and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that\
  \ particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if\
  \ it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on\
  \ such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions\
  \ to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person\
  \ or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims\
  \ licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale\
  \ of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means\
  \ the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\"\
  \ means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License\
  \ (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any\
  \ work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from)\
  \ the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations,\
  \ or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\
  \n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults\
  \ from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program,\
  \ including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains\
  \ any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain\
  \ only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program\
  \ solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\n\
  or Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or\
  \ b) making available\nin any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"\
  Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including\
  \ but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration\
  \ files.\n\n\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\n\
  Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\nexceptions or\
  \ additional permissions as identified by the initial\nContributor.\n\n2. GRANT\
  \ OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
  \  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license\
  \ to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform,\
  \ Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and\
  \ such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\
  \ hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n \
  \ license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and\
  \ otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source\
  \ Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the\
  \ Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the\
  \ Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be\
  \ covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\
  \ other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n\
  \  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor\
  \ grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
  \  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent\
  \ or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor\
  \ disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity\
  \ based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition\
  \ to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n\
  \  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights\
  \ needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to\
  \ allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\
  \ to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor\
  \ represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its\
  \ Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
  \n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes\
  \ additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement)\
  \ as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a\
  \ Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
  \n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program\
  \ must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2,\
  \ and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source\
  \ Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients\
  \ how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n\
  \  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program\
  \ under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n\
  \     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties\
  \ and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions\
  \ of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\
  \ and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on\
  \ behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct,\
  \ indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
  \n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the\
  \ Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution\
  \ of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n\
  \     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\
  \n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i)\
  \ is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available\
  \ under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the\
  \ Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program\
  \ may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n \
  \ b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\
  \n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution\
  \ notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained\
  \ within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided\
  \ that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
  \nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith\
  \ respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended\
  \ to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes\
  \ the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does\
  \ not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor\
  \ includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"\
  Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor\
  \ (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively\
  \ \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by\
  \ a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the\
  \ acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution\
  \ of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section\
  \ do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual\
  \ property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must:\
  \ a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b)\
  \ allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial\
  \ Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\
  \ Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example,\
  \ a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product\
  \ X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor\
  \ then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those\
  \ performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n\
  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims\
  \ against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties,\
  \ and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result,\
  \ the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT\
  \ AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\
  \ LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\
  \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES\
  \ OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\
  PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness\
  \ of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its\
  \ exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks\
  \ and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss\
  \ of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
  \n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,\
  \ AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n\
  SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY,\
  \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER\
  \ CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,\
  \ OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE\
  \ OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,\
  \ EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision\
  \ of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall\
  \ not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this\
  \ Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall\
  \ be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\
  \ enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n\
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram\
  \ itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware)\
  \ infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under\
  \ Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll\
  \ Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply\
  \ with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure\
  \ such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance.\
  \ If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to\
  \ cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\
  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted\
  \ by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is\
  \ permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid\
  \ inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following\
  \ manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including\
  \ revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n\
  Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial\
  \ Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve\
  \ as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the\
  \ Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including\
  \ Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement\
  \ under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\
  \ is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n\
  Contributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections\
  \ 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual\
  \ property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n\
  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this\
  \ Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable\
  \ by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary\
  \ rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses\
  \ Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\n\
  Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse\
  \ Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {{name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions\
  \ or additional permissions here}}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement,\
  \ including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under\
  \ Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice\
  \ in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as\
  \ a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n\
  \  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright\
  \ ownership."
