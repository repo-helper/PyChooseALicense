  \ CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION\
  \ OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE\
  \ COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS\
  \ MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION\

  \ FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n    HEREUNDER.\n\
  \nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically\
  \ confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\n\
  and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship\
  \ and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish\
  \ those rights to a Work for\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,\
  \ cultural and\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and\
  \ without fear\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate\
  \ in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\n\
  and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners\
  \ may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the\
  \ further production of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation\
  \ or greater distribution for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of\
  \ others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\n\
  expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating\
  \ CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner\
  \ of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0\
  \ to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge\
  \ of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended\
  \ legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work\
  \ made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring\
  \ rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include,\
  \ but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt,\
  \ distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral\
  \ rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity\
  \ and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
  \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\
  \     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting\
  \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database\
  \ rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament\
  \ and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases,\
  \ and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or\
  \ successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent\
  \ or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or\
  \ treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest\
  \ extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby\
  \ overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,\
  \ and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated\
  \ claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\
  \ as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\n\
  worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including\
  \ future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number\
  \ of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation\
  \ commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\
  \ the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment\
  \ of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not\
  \ be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other\
  \ legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\n\
  as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License\
  \ Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid\
  \ or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the\
  \ maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of\
  \ Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants\
  \ to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable,\
  \ non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright\
  \ and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n\
  maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions),\
  \ (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv)\
  \ for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising\
  \ or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective\
  \ as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\
  \ License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable\
  \ law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\n\
  of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not\
  \ (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the\
  \ Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to\
  \ the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\
  \n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer\
  \ are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this\
  \ document.\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n\
  \    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory\
  \ or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability,\
  \ fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent\
  \ or other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether\
  \ or not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
  \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
  \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
  \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
  \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
  \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\
  \ and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document and\
  \ has no duty or obligation with respect to\n    this CC0 or use of the Work."
