  \ June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\
  \ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license\
  \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n  This version of the GNU Lesser\
  \ General Public License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of\
  \ the GNU General Public\nLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed\
  \ below.\n\n  0. Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers\
  \ to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers\
  \ to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to\
  \ a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined\
  \ Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an\
  \ interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n\
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using\
  \ an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced\
  \ by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version\
  \ of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\n\
  Version\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\n\
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions\
  \ of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application,\
  \ and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for\
  \ a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application,\
  \ including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work\
  \ from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\
  \n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work\
  \ under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the\
  \ GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the\
  \ Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data\
  \ to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument\
  \ passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n\
  version:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort\
  \ to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function\
  \ or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose\
  \ remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional\
  \ permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating\
  \ Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application\
  \ may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You\
  \ may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the\
  \ incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\n\
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or\
  \ fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent\
  \ notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and\
  \ that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany\
  \ the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n\
  \  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice\
  \ that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions\
  \ of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging\
  \ such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent\
  \ notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it\
  \ and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany\
  \ the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n\
  \   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution,\
  \ include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well\
  \ as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license\
  \ document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding\
  \ Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application\
  \ Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n\
  \       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the\
  \ Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified\
  \ by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n  \
  \     1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.\
  \  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library\
  \ already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly\
  \ with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with\
  \ the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only\
  \ if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section\
  \ 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary\
  \ to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by\
  \ recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked\
  \ Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n\
  \   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If\
  \ you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner\
  \ specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\
  \n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work\
  \ based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\n\
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey\
  \ such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\
  \n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on\
  \ the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under\
  \ the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library\
  \ that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find\
  \ the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions\
  \ of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may\
  \ publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License\
  \ from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present\
  \ version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each\
  \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received\
  \ it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public\
  \ License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following\
  \ the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\n\
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does\
  \ not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may\
  \ choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by\
  \ the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies\
  \ that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public\
  \ License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version\
  \ is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary."
